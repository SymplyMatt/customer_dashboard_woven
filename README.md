# Frontend Exercise Assignment

Welcome to the repository for my completed frontend exercise assignment. I'm excited to showcase the work I've done in implementing the Figma design using Vue 3 and TailwindCSS. I've taken this opportunity to go above and beyond the requirements to demonstrate my skills and capabilities.

## Key Accomplishments

Here's an overview of what I've accomplished in this project:

1. **Dark Mode**: I've introduced a "dark mode" feature to the design, highlighting my problem-solving skills and consideration for user preferences. This feature ensures that the application is comfortable for users in various lighting conditions.

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: The application is designed to be fully responsive on all screen sizes, delivering a seamless user experience across different devices.

3. **Animations**: I've integrated animations, including spinner animations and skeleton loading animations, to elevate the user interface. These animations provide valuable feedback during data loading and contribute to a more engaging user experience.

4. **Accessibility**: Accessibility has been a priority. The application complies with best practices for web accessibility to ensure that it is usable by all users.

5. **API Interaction**: To showcase my proficiency in both creating and consuming APIs, I've seamlessly integrated external endpoints into specific components. This integration showcases my ability to work with external data sources, enhancing the application's functionality.

6. **Modularity**: I've structured the project using small, reusable components, emphasizing modularity and maintainability. This approach facilitates the management and scalability of the application.
